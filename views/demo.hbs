    <li>You wanna make a linear register of important<br> or interesting and funny facts of your life</li>
    <li>Think about a theme: your trips? Books you’ve<br> read? Professional achievements?</li>
    <li>Create a timeline regarding your theme:<br> add a fact, a date, a description and a picture if you want</li>
    <li>And voilà! Your facts will be displayed in the timeline according<br> to their dates. And you can have as many timelines you want!</li>
